# connection-resistance-demo
This repository contains a Mathematica notebook walkthrough for the calculation of effective resistance on a connection graph, as defined in the paper:

Chung, Fan, and Wenbo Zhao. "Ranking and sparsifying a connection graph." International Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the Web-Graph. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2012.

The notebook was written in Wolfram Mathematica 13.0. No support is planned for future versions of the software unless by request. Mathematica was chosen for its support of symbolic algebra calculation capabilities.
