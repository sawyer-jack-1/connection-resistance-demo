### Overview of folders and files
- config: Contains configuration files for the dumbell and wheatstonebridge graphs
- Figures: Contains figures generated when running the experiments
- utilities: Contains the code
- definitions.py: Contains paths to ROOT and configuration files
- experiment_dumbbell.py: Contains the experiments on the dumbbell graph
- experiment_wheatstonebridge.py: Contains the experiments on the wheatstonebridge graph


### Instructions on how to run experiments
Running the script experiment_dumbbell.py generates the connection resistance (CR) 
from Def 6.7 and the CR from Chung et al (2014) for the graph configuration
in config_dumbbell_graph.yaml

Running the script experiment_wheatstonebridge.py generates the connection resistance (CR) 
from Def 6.7 and the CR from Chung et al (2014) for the graph configuration
in config_wheatstonebridge_graph.yaml
